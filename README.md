# Project overview
In today’s digital age, social media platforms such as Twitter have become powerful sources of real-time customer feedback and opinions. Understanding the sentiment expressed by customers toward specific brands and products is essential for businesses to make informed decisions, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain a positive brand reputation. 

The goal of this project aims to develop a sentimental analysis model specifically tailored to analyze Twitter data related to Google, Apple, and other products.
